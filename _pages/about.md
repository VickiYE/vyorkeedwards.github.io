Vicki obtained her undergraduate degree in Archaeology from UCL, going on to combine work as a commercial archaeologist with pursuing a Masters in Forensic Archaeological Science at UCL. After stints working in museums and for a classical music company, in 2005 she joined the [Medical Research Council's Clinical Trials Unit](https://www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/) as a part-time Trials Assistant. Over the following thirteen years she worked as a Data Manager, Trial Manager and latterly Data Scientist within the unit, with a particular emphasis on working on phase III/IV tuberculosis drugs trials. Alongside her work she undertook a part-time PhD in Human Bioarchaeology, taught as a sessional lecturer in the subject for Birkbeck, and was co-Editor of the [Journal of Open Archaeology Data](https://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/) for a number of years. However, she really enjoyed her work with the living in clinical trials, and decided to pursue her interest in the under-researched area of Trial Conduct Methodology, taking up the post of Research Fellow in October 2018. She is keen to help to develop the evidence base for trial conduct and has a particular interest in issues around data quality, monitoring, and data sharing.
