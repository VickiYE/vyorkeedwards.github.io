After stints working in museums and for a classical music company, in 2005 she joined the [Medical Research Council's Clinical Trials Unit](https://www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/) as a part-time Trials Assistant. Over the following thirteen years she worked as a Data Manager, Trial Manager and latterly Data Scientist within the unit, with a particular emphasis on working on phase III/IV tuberculosis drugs trials. Alongside her work she undertook a part-time PhD in Human Bioarchaeology, taught as a sessional lecturer in the subject for Birkbeck, and was co-Editor of the [Journal of Open Archaeology Data](https://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/) for a number of years. In 2018 she took up the post of Research Fellow in Trial Conduct Methodology, helping to develop the evidence base for trial conduct including trial monitoring, data sharing, and the use of health systems data in clinical trials. In February 2024 she joined UCL's [Centre for Advanced Research Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/advanced-research-computing-centre) as a Senior Research Data Steward, to pursue her long term interest in all things data.
